## Setting up the Virtual Environment

To set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Now your virtual environment is set up and the necessary packages are installed.
